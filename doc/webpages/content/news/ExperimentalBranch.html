The MEGAlib experimental branch on github.com
</neodym-blog-title>

<neodym-blog-summary>
All new MEGAlib developments will now occur in the experimental branch as precursor to MEGAlib 3.0. MEGAlib 2.x and its master branch are just in maintenance mode.

<neodym-blog-body>
<p>In order to separate the rapid developments for the analysis of the data from the COSI balloon flight, and in order to not require 100% backward compatibility, a new MEGAlib branch has been established, called experimental.</p>
<p>It is intended that this branch will eventually evolve into MEGAlib 3.0.</p>
<p>As always great care will be taken that none of the standard simulation/analysis pathways will become broken. This should be achievable since we add just new features to existing MEGAlib tools.</p>
<p>All new developments are currently happening in this branch, MEGAlib 2.x and its master branch are just in maintenance mode, i.e. we will just add critical bug fixes and enable compatibility with new ROOT / operating system versions.</p>
