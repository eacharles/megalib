MEGAlib website refresh
</neodym-blog-title>

<neodym-blog-summary>
The MEGAlib website is now based on my on static website generator, <a href="https://github.com/zoglauer/neodym" target=_blank>Neodym</a>.

<p>After one to many emails from Drupal requiring once again an update, it was time for something different. MEGAlib's website is completely static, thus using a content authoring system was overkill. Evaluating a few static website generator, unfortunately none came close to fullfill my key requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the content to be written in html to allow for custom css and javascript for the individual pages.</li>
<li>Provide an option for a picture show.</li>
<li>Setup a bibliography for my personal website using bibtex input files.</li>
<li>Allow news/blog entries.</li>
<li>Create a navigation pane from html.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I had to do it myself, again. And during the dark winter nights of 2017/2018 <a href="https://github.com/zoglauer/neodym" target=_blank>Neodym</a> was born.</p>
