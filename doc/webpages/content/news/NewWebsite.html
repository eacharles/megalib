MEGAlib website refresh
</neodym-blog-title>

<neodym-blog-summary>
The MEGAlib website is now based on the static website generator <a href="https://github.com/zoglauer/neodym" target=_blank>Neodym</a> and no longer Drupal.

<p>After one too many emails from Drupal requiring once again an update, it was time to say good-bye to Drupal. MEGAlib's website is completely static, thus using a content authoring system is complete overkill. After evaluating a few static website generators, unfortunately none came close to fulfill my key requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the content needs to be written in html to allow for custom css and javascript for individual pages.</li>
<li>Provide an option for a slide show.</li>
<li>Create a bibliography for my personal website using bibtex input files.</li>
<li>Allow news/blog entries.</li>
<li>Create a navigation pane from html.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus during the dark winter nights of 2017/2018 <a href="https://github.com/zoglauer/neodym" target=_blank>Neodym</a> was born.</p>
