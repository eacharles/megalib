<h1>Feedback</h1>


<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or problems, which are not covered by the documentation, feel free the ask the <a href="contact">developers</a>.</p>



<h2>Bug reports and feature request</h2>
<p>For bug reports and feature requests please use the <a href="https://github.com/zoglauer/megalib/issues" target=_blank>issue tracker for MEGAlib at github</a>. Naturally, you can also find a list of known issues there.</p>
<p>Please be specific when you report an issue. Provide me with information about what version you are using, and let me know how to reproduce the problem.</p>
<p>If you have example code which causes the problem, you can always <a href="contact">email it to me</a>.</p>



<h2>Integration of your MEGAlib additions/bugfixes etc. into the main MEGAlib repository</h2>

<p>Please use the standard github tools for that, i.e. create a fork, commit and push your modifications to your own fork, and send me a pull request.</p>

<p>Remember to always sync your fork to the latest version of MEGAlib before you send a pull request. Here are the steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have the MEGAlib github as remote:
<pre>git remote -v show</pre>
should list 
<pre>
upstream        https://github.com/zoglauer/megalib.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/zoglauer/megalib.git (push)
</pre>
If not, then add it:
<pre>git remote add upstream https://github.com/zoglauer/megalib.git</pre>
</li>

<li>Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches
<pre>git fetch upstream</pre>
</li>

<li>Make sure that you're on your own master (for current release) or experimental (for next release) branch:
<pre>git checkout experimental</pre>
</li>

<li>Replay the remote MEGAlib updates on your own branch
<pre>git rebase upstream/experimental</pre>
</li>

<li>Recompile your MEGalib version, and make sure everything still works as expected:
<pre>
make clean
make
</pre>
</li>

<li>Now push it back to your own fork
<pre>git push -f origin experimental</pre>
</li>
</ul>


<h2> Submitting a patch</h2>
<p>If you want to submit a patch instead, please make sure you start your development with a clone of the git repository (if you used the setup script in default mode, you are good) and on the master branch:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/zoglauer/megalib.git
git checkout master</code></pre>

<p>Make your changes and commit them:</p>

<pre><code>git add MyModifiedFile.cxx 
git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Then create the patch:</p>

<pre><code>git format-patch -1</code></pre>

<p>Finally email me the patch - see <a href="contact">Contacts</a> for my email.</p>
